1. To try it out, download the contents of dist (prog02.jar and
   csc220.txt) to your desktop (or home directory).  Run

	java -jar prog02.jar

   or double click on it.  You have to have csc220.txt in the SAME
   directory.

2. Go into doc in the browser and look at the documentation for the
   PhoneDirectory interface and the UserInterface interface.

3. For everything you did in #1, decide which methods in #2 it is
   calling.  Discuss.

4. In IntelliJ, create a new prog02 package in your csc220 project src
   folder and download the source files from the src/prog02 web
   directory into src/prog02 directory.  Reload.

5. Download dist/csc220.txt into your project directory, usually
   IdeaProjects/csc220.  Reload the project so it appears in IntelliJ.

6. Implement processCommands in Main.  I did case 1, partially, in class:

                          name = ui.getInfo("Enter the name ");
                          number = pd.lookupEntry(name);
                          ui.sendMessage(name + " has number " + number);

   This should work fine if everything is normal.  Look up Victor.

   What if the user tries to CANCEL when asked to enter the name?  Fix.

   What if the user enters a blank name?  A blank name is NOT allowed.
   (However, a blank phone number IS allowed.)  Fix.

   What if the name isn't in the directory?  (Check the documentation
   for lookupEntry.)

   Do the other cases.  DO NOT CALL lookupEntry in any of the other
   cases.



HOMEWORK

7. If the directory is changed, set changed=true.

   If save is selected, set changed=false.

   If the user selects exit, check if changed is true.  If so, ask the
   user if they really want to exit without saving.  Using the
   UserInteface ui, give the choices YES or NO.  Only exit if the user
   selects YES.


For homework, you will implement SortedPD which stores the entries in
order by name and uses binary search to find entries.

8. Modify Main so it uses a SortedPD instead of an ArrayBasedPD.

   Copy the methods add, find, and remove from ArrayBasedPD to the
   SortedPD class, including their Javadoc comments.

   Do step 5 again.  Visit csc220.txt in IntelliJ.  You should see

Victor
vjm@miami.edu
Collin
cdc104@miami.edu
Elizabeth
exv344@miami.edu
Patrick
pkm492@miami.edu
Jack
jam771@miami.edu

   Run Main, and tell the program to remove Collin and save.  Reload
   the csc220.txt window in IntelliJ.  You should see

Victor
vjm@miami.edu
Jack
jam771@miami.edu
Elizabeth
exv344@miami.edu
Patrick
pkm492@miami.edu

   Why?  Because the way it removes Collin is by copying the last
   entry (Jack) into the same location (and decrementing size so Jack
   does not appear twice).


9. Exit the program.  Restore csc220.txt by saving it from the browser
   again and refreshing the window in IntelliJ.  Modify remove (in
   SortedPD) so instead of copying entry [size-1] on top of entry
   [index] it moves entries [index+1] to [size-1] each back one.  Now
   when you run Main, remove Collin, and save, and refresh csc220.txt,
   you should see

Victor
vjm@miami.edu
Elizabeth
exv344@miami.edu
Patrick
pkm492@miami.edu

jam771@miami.edu

   Do not modify add or find until you have this working.


10. add adds a new entry at [index] by first copying [index] to [size]
   and then putting the new entry at [index].  Modify it so it moves
   all the entries from [index] to [size-1] forward one index before
   putting the new entry at [index].

   Test add by (temporarily) setting index=0 at the top of add instead
   of using the value it is given.  Run the program and save the
   directory.  Look at csc220.txt.  Add a new entry (like your name
   and email).  Save and look at csc220.txt.  Did the new entry end up
   first in the file?

   Now try setting index=size/2 and running the same test.  Does the
   new entry end up in the right place?

   Once you are sure add is working, remove the temporary line
   index=size/2.


11. Now it is time to change find so it uses binary search.  Do we
  need to sort the input file?  No!  Why not?  Object oriented
  programming.  The loadData method in ArrayBasedPD will call
  addOrChangeEntry which will call YOUR add method to add each
  entry.  addOrChangeEntry also calls YOUR find method.  Your find
  method will tell your addOrChangeEntry method where to put the
  entries so it will be sorted.  If this makes your head explode,
  don't worry about it.  Just trust the fact that if every method does
  its job properly, the whole thing will work!

  find needs two variables, low and high, initially 0 and size-1.
  We are searching the range from low to high, inclusive.

  The following is a true statement (NOT code you implement):

    If i < low and [i] is a valid entry, its key is < name.

    If j > high and [j] is a valid entry, its key is > name.

  This is true at the start because this is NO valid i < 0 and NO
  valid j > size-1.

  The following IS code you implement:

  While low is not greater than high:

    Calculate middle, halfway between low and high.

    If the entry at [middle] is < name, then we know that entries [0]
    to [middle] are all < name.  So we can safely set
    low = middle + 1.

    Else if the entry at [middle] is > name, then we know the entries
    from [middle] to [size-1] are > name.  So we can set high = middle - 1.

    Else the entry at [middle] must be equal to name, so we can return
    middle.

  When the loop is done, low will greater than high.  That means the
  entry at [low] is is the lowest entry that is > name.  (Why?)  If
  name is in the directory, it has to be at index [low].  If name is
  not there, that is where we should put name.  So what should we return?

  Test your program.  Restore csc220.txt from the browser, run Main,
  add yourself, save, and refresh the csc220.txt window in Eclipse.
  You should see this (your position will depend on the alphabet).

12. I will put a folder named test into your shared OneDrive folder.

    Link it into your project folder like you did src (but with the name test).

    In IntelliJ, reload csc220.

    Rightclick on the test folder, "Mark Directory as >",
    select "Test Sources Root".

    Open (double-click) test/prog02/SortedPDTest.

    Hover over red junit (in import line) and ask IntelliJ to install the library.

    Ditto the red jupiter.

    Click the green triangle next to "class SortedPDTest".

    Did you pass all the tests?


13. Go back to processCommands and check your program carefully.  Is
    it the best it can be?
